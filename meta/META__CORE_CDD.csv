It is primarily used to group a set of, target fields to allow mapping one source record to, multiple instances of the same target file., , For example, say fields 5, 6 and 7 of a source file, mapped to fields A, B and C of file X.  That would, create one record in file X.  If fields 8, 9 and, 10 also mapped to fields A, B and C of file X, but, were to create a new record, then in the mapping, of fields 8 to A, fields 9 to B and fields 10 to C,, the same logical prefix would be given to those, 3 mappings.  This would tell the generator that, the fields 5/6/7 mapping creates one record and, the 8/9/10 mapping creates another.  This is, common on tapes that have test scores.  One set, of tests needs to create one record in, STUDENT.NON.COURSES and another set needs to, create another record in STUDENT.NON.COURSES,, both for the same person., , Note that when a logical prefix is specified for, target fields, the required fields of the target, file all need the logical prefix as well.  The, generator will not get any fields from the previous, instance of the target file.  In other words, if, the following mapping exists:, , Source    Target   Logical Pfx, , Test Name      A.TEST.NAME, Test Score 1   A.TEST.SCORE, Test Score 1 Date   A.TEST.SCORE.DATE, Test Score 2   A.TEST.SCORE  SCORE2, Test Score 2 Date   A.TEST.SCORE.DATE  SCORE2, , If the record for Score 2 also needed the test name,, an additional mapping needs to be specified:, , Source    Target   Logical Pfx, , Test Name A.TEST.NAME   SCORE2, , Since a source field can be mapped to multiple, targets, this is an acceptable mapping., , So it is not assumed that just because test name, went on the first record, it will be put on the, second as well.  This needs to be explicitly mapped., , Any non-generated code (hook code, etc.) needs to, reference the prefix to keep the record instances, straight.  So to deal with the first record, the, field names are A.TEST.NAME, etc.  To deal with, the second record, the field names are, SCORE2.A.TEST.SCORE, etc.","Logical, Prefix","ELF.MAPS","","","1996-02-15","SMG","","","2020-05-27T14:56:18.712Z"

For example, for GP (grandparent),, this inverse is GC (grandchild); for PCO (parent company),, this might be SUB (subsidiary)., , This is used to determine the correct relationship to return, based on whose relationship is requested. A RELATION record, is keyed by two PERSON IDs (ID*ID).  The lesser (numerically), ID is always first.  The relation type is always of the first, ID.  This means that to look at the relationship of the second, ID from the first ID's point of view, the relationship to show, is the inverse., , For example, suppose ID 123 is the granddaughter of ID 234.  The, RELATION ID is 123*234.  The relation type on the RELATION record, is GC (or whatever means grandchild), since 123 is the lesser of, the two IDs.  On REL, if 123 is in context (in the header block),, then 234 shows in the Other group with a relation of Grandfather., We knew to show grandfather because GC has an inverse type of,, say, GP (grandparent), and the male description of that is, ""Grandfather"".  If 234 is in context, then 123 shows in the Other, group with a relation of Granddaughter.  In this case, the inverse, was not needed because the lesser ID would have its own relation, type on RELATION, and so for 123, the female description of GC,, ""Granddaughter"", is shown., , Many relationships do not have an inverse, such as spouse.  In, this case, the relation type is used for both IDs, using only, gender to distinguish, if male and female descriptions have, been provided.  If ID 123 is married to 345, and 345, has a gender of male, then if 123 is in context, then 345, would show as ""Husband"" if that was in the male relationship, description. If 345 is in context, 123 would show as ""Wife"" if, that was in the female relationship description.  If the male, and female description were left blank, then ""Spouse"" would show, for either.  If a relation did not have a gender, which would be, the case for organizations, then the relationship type description, shows, which should not denote a gender.","Invers, Rel, Type","RELATION.TYPES","N","RELATION.TYPES","2003-09-08","SMG","","","2020-05-27T14:56:19.384Z"
