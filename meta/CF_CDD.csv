Thorne, This element was created for work associated with activity 6502.63., , This field contains the PROJECTS.LINE.ITEMS ID associated with a GL, number on a BPO. This information is necessary for the BPO.GL.HISTORY, file since a GL number may appear on multiple GL line items for a, BPO (if it is associated with different project information). When a, voucher is created for a BPO, BPO.GL.HISTORY records are created with, a BPOGL.TRAN.TYPE of 'O'riginal. These records do not have a reference, to the voucher from which they were created. However, if the voucher, amounts are maintained, S.POST.BPO uses these records to calculate, credit and debit amounts for an EP posting record to un-encumber or, relieve more encumbrances from the BPO. It uses the GL number as a, unique identifier for this. However, the GL number on a BPO is not, necessarily a unique identifier on BPO with project information. The, combination of GL number and project line item will become the unique, identifier for this logic.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BPO.GL.HISTORY","","","0","2003-06-20","GTT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0",""
